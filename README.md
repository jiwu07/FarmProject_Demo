# FarmProject_Demo

A fixed-perspective 3D farming game demo developed in Unity 2022.3.12f1, primarily built for Android with support for mouse input on PC. This project showcases core gameplay systems including player movement, task system, planting mechanics, inventory and building system, character switching, and clean architecture.

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- Click or tap to move and interact with the world.
- Free exploration in your own farm with interactive elements.
- Task system: accept tasks from the task panel, track progress, and submit for rewards.
- Planting system: buy seeds, plant them on land tiles, water them, and harvest when mature.
- Gacha system: click on the carrot-shaped building to play a mini lottery game and win items or coins.
- Character system: switch between characters, each with unique abilities.
- Inventory system: access your backpack, place objects on land, or retrieve them into inventory via placement mode.
- Dynamic UI: coin counter, task notifications, and real-time feedback on user actions.
- Plant growth: progresses over time with visual cues (e.g., process bar, star icon when interaction is possible).
- Notification system: informs the player when they lack coins, appropriate abilities, etc.

## üë• Character Abilities
